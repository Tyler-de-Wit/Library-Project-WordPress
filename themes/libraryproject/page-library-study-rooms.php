            <p>The library at NMT's Perth campus has a dozen study rooms that students can utilise for holding meetings, collaborating with each other or to enjoy the quiet to get some work done while still being inside of the campus.</p>
            <p>These study rooms can be booked free of charge by going and speaking to the library staff at the front desk as soon as you enter the library.</p>
