        <div class="card-body">
            <ol>
                <li><span class="bold-text">Subject Line</span> - Clearly state what the email is about in the subject line, keeping it short and simple.<hr></li>
                <li><span class="bold-text">Proofread</span> - Before you send any email make sure you reread it checking for any spelling, grammatical errors and does it make sense.<hr></li>
                <li><span class="bold-text">Reply All</span> - When replying to an email only use "Reply All" when necessary as people don't need to be receiving emails that don't directly concern them.<hr></li>
                <li><span class="bold-text">Signatures</span> - Depending on your role and who you are sending the email to changes the signature you should include at the bottom. However a good rule of thumb is to include your name, title / role, company and your contact number<hr></li>
                <li><span class="bold-text">Formatlity</span> - Emails are a formal type of communication therefore the way you write should also be formal. Address the recipiant at the start of each email "Dear ___", don't use any informal language such as "u" instead of "you" or "tmr" instead of "tomorrow", always end the email with "Kind Regards" or "Sincerely".<hr></li>
                <li><span class="bold-text">To, CC and Bcc</span> - Any email address you place in the "To" field is who the email is directly addressed to, this should be the same person or group of people who you address in the first line of the email. Any email address in the "CC" or (Carbon Copy) field is for people who should be informed of the contents of the email but are not the direct recipiant. Any email address you place in the "BCC" field is essentially the same as "CC" with the difference being that their email address are hidden from the primary recipiants of the email.<hr></li>
                <li><span class="bold-text">Write email in seperate document first</span> - It can be useful to open up a text document and write your email in that first so you can check spelling and grammer easier. It also has the benefit of not being able to accidentally send the email before you are finished writing it.<hr></li>
                <li><span class="bold-text">Check recipient</span> - Make sure you double check the recipiant email addresses, there is nothing worse that accidentally sending an email to the wrong person especially if the email contains any sensitive content.<hr></li>
                <li><span class="bold-text">Formatting</span> - Make sure that you use approprite colours, fonts, sizes and spacing when writing an email to keep it easy to read.<hr></li>
                <li><span class="bold-text">Confidentiality</span> - Take into consideration that nothing that is sent through email is ever completely confidential. The recipiants can forward the email on to others and all emails can be accessed through the service provider.</li>
